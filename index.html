  I consider myself a Nail Technician. I am a biracial teenager. I have a medical condition called severe asthma and sometimes it's hard to cope with. I live with
  my mom and my 3 other brothers and I am a middle child. When I grow up to be an adult, I want to be someone who inspires people and someone who helps people who
  have to deal with things in their lives.
  
  I love my life but sometimes my family is just too much, but I do have someone who takes me away from that.
